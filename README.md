# deno-html-includes
A proof of concept using Deno to create HTML includes.

## Try it out

Navigate to the project directory in your shell of choice and run the following command:

```
deno run --allow-read --allow-write build.js
```

This will create the `index.html` file with the content from the header and footer templates.
